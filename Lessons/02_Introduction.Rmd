## Lesson Objectives
1. Justify components of effective data visualization
2. Apply R coding skills to create effective visualizations
3. Review and/or develop skills in R coding and syntax

## Opening Discussion
What makes an effective data visualization? What are the essential components/characteristics, and what are optional but nice-to-have components/characteristics? 

Come up with a consensus list among your group members. 

Units for measurements
Appropriatelty sized axes to fit all of the data points
Labeled axes
Acessible color palettes (color blindness)
Type of graph should represent data properly
Reproducibility
Legible font sizes
Axis scale


Compare your list to other groups' lists. 

## Exploring web resources for visualization

1. Navigate to https://www.data-to-viz.com/.
2. Think of a dataset that you or someone in your field might want to visualize. What types of variables does this dataset contain? What information might you want to convey with a visualization?

3. Scroll to the "Explore" section of the website. Follow the flow chart to find a type of graph that would suit your data. Click for more information and a link to the R Graph Gallery. If there are multiple options for graphing your data, how might you choose between them?

4. Discuss and compare your findings with a partner.
5. Scroll further down to the "Caveats" section of the website and click "See the Collection." Choose five topics to explore (some of these are incomplete so choose another if that is the case). Write some notes about what you learned below.

6. Discuss and compare your findings with a partner.

## A note on color palettes

In general, the ggplot base color palettes are not the most effective option for data visualization. Compiled below is a list of color palettes available in R that may serve your purposes better. Note that when working with multiple colors, you must choose between sequential, diverging, and qualitative color palettes. Under what circumstances might each be useful?

## Session Set Up

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("~/Desktop/Hydrologic Data Analysis/Hydrologic_Data_Analysis")

```

```{r}
install.packages(tidyverse)
install.packages(dataRetrieval)
install.packages(zoo)
install.packages(ggrepel)

```


## Data Visualization Challenge

We will be exploring discharge data for the Eno River, aided by the [dataRetrieval package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html). A basic ggplot is provided for you, and an image of an edited graph is provided along with hints of how to produce it. 

Work with your group to reproduce the graph. This may require dividing up tasks and sharing code as you complete each piece of editing.

```{r}
# Import data
EnoDischarge <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "02096500",
                     parameterCd = "00060", # discharge (ft3/s)
                     startDate = "2009-08-01",
                     endDate = "2019-07-31")



```
# Look at the data frame in your Environment tab.

# Renaming columns (one method of multiple)
```{r}
names(EnoDischarge)[4:5] <- c("Discharge", "Approval.Code")
```



# dataRetrieval also includes attribute information
```{r}
attr(EnoDischarge, "variableInfo")
  # note: imperial, not metric
```


```{r}
attr(EnoDischarge, "siteInfo")
```




  
# Build a ggplot
```{r}
EnoPlot <- 
  ggplot(EnoDischarge, aes(x = Date, y = Discharge)) +
         geom_line() +
         xlab("Year")
print(EnoPlot)

```



Challenge: 

1. Build a plot called EnoPlot2.
```{r}
EnoPlot2 <- 
  ggplot(EnoDischarge, aes(x = Date, y = Discharge)) +
         geom_line() +
         xlab("Year")+gabytheme
print(EnoPlot2)
```


2. Add a column to your data frame for discharge in meters cubed per second

hint: package dplyr in tidyverse includes a `mutate` function


```{r}
EnoDischargeFinal <- mutate(EnoDischarge, Discharge_meters_cubed_second = Discharge/35.31)
```

3. Add a column in your data frame for a 30-day rolling mean of the metric discharge
###Calculate mean for first thirty days, 
```{r}

```

hint: package dplyr in tidyverse includes a `mutate` function
hint: package zoo includes a `rollmean` function

4. Update your ggplot theme
```{r}
gabytheme <- theme_bw(base_size = 14) + 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(face="bold", size="16", color="tomato2", hjust=0.5),
        axis.title=element_text(face="bold.italic", size=11, color="black"),
axis.text = element_text(face="bold", size=10, color = "black"), 
panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightgray", color="darkblue"), 
panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", size = 2),
legend.position = "top", legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", color="black"),
            legend.key = element_rect(fill="transparent", color="NA"))
```

hint: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

5. Edit axes
```{r}
EnoPlot2 <- 
  ggplot(EnoDischargeFinal, aes(x = Date, y = Discharge)) +
         geom_line() +
         xlab("Year")+gabytheme
print(EnoPlot2)

```

6. Create two geom_line aesthetics, one for metric discharge and one for rolling mean of metric discharge. Color these differently.
```{r}
EnoPlot2 <- 
  ggplot(EnoDischargeFinal, aes(x = Date, y = Discharge), color="blue") +
         geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Discharge_meters_cubed_second), color="pink") +
          labs(title="Eno River Discharge Over Time")+
         xlab("Year")+gabytheme
print(EnoPlot2)
```

7. Label the day that Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina. 
```{r}
EnoPlot2 <- 
  ggplot(EnoDischargeFinal, aes(x = Date, y = Discharge), color="blue") +
         geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Discharge_meters_cubed_second), color="pink") +
          labs(title="Eno River Discharge Over Time")+
         xlab("Year")+gabytheme
  

print(EnoPlot2)


```

hint: look up this date
hint: package ggrepel includes a `geom_label_repel` function

8. Add a legend. 

hint: Google "add legend two geom layers ggplot"

```{r}  


```

## Closing Discussion
In what ways was the second plot a more effective visualization than the first? 

What portions of the coding were challenging for you?
